## **Training the AI**

Howard Craft uses a modular training pipeline to fine-tune its AI capabilities. Here's an overview:

### **1. Conversational AI (LLaMA3)**
The conversational model enables Howard Craft to interact with users. Use the `fine_tune_llama3.py` script to train the model on new dialogue datasets:
```bash
python training_scripts/fine_tune_llama3.py --data datasets/conversational/ --epochs 5
```

### **2. Object Detection**
To enable Howard Craft to recognize objects with its camera, train the vision model using the `object_recognition.py` script:
```bash
python training_scripts/object_recognition.py --data datasets/object_detection/ --output pre_trained_models/object_detection_model.pth
```

### **3. Speech-to-Text (Parakeet ASR)**
Enhance Howard Craft's ability to understand speech by updating the ASR model:
```bash
python training_scripts/update_asr_model.py --data datasets/audio_data/
```
